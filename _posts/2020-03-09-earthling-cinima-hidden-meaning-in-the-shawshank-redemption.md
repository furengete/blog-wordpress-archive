Greetings, and welcome to Earthling Cinema. I am your host, Garyx Wormuloid. This week’s artifact is The Shawshank Redemption, based on the **novella** by acclaimed word- person King Stephen, who ruled America with an iron fist for over two hundred years.  
用铁拳统治美国文坛二百多年的史蒂芬·金的短篇故事丽塔·海沃斯和肖申克广受好评。这周我们来谈谈这个故事被人拍成的电影肖申克的救赎。

The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Earthling Andy Dufresne, a suspiciously over-qualified banker who is sent to prison for the murder of his nameless wife. Once **incarcerated**, he befriends Red, who is known to locate certain items from time to time, and whose gentle **baritone** could **lull** me right to sleep.  
肖申克的救赎讲了一位有名的银行家安迪疑似谋杀他没那么有名的妻子被判入狱。被监禁后与可以时不时找到特别物品的红交了朋友。红的嗓音可使我入眠。

Tired of doing boring stuff like sliming the tops of buildings, Andy offers the guards financial advice, which is like **catnip** for humans. The Warden quickly gives Andy an unpaid internship, which seems like it’s gonna be a great opportunity, but ends up just being a lot of bitch work.  
安迪厌倦了在屋顶上瘦身就去给狱警提财务建议，然而这就像给人吸食猫薄荷。典狱长发现了安迪的才能就马上给了他一个无薪实习的机会，实际上就是做一些繁杂的工作。

After twenty years, Andy decides he’s had enough, despite the fact that he’s barely aged a day. The guys all think he’s gonna kill himself, but why bother when he’s got that sweet hole in his wall \[shot of guys looking into the hole\]? Later, Red gets lonely, and asks if he can go now, and everybody says ok. He easily finds Andy halfway around the world, **presumably** using satellite technology, and then they chill at Club Med.  
二十年之后，好像并没有变老的安迪决定他受够了，大家都以为他要自杀。反正他那面墙里有一个洞，不需要为他担心。然后红就孤独了，问能不能出去，大家说行。他轻易地找到了在世界另一边的安迪，想必是用了卫星技术，在那之后他们在度假村玩。

Other than the value of keeping posters in your room, the primary theme of The Shawshank Redemption is freedom.  
除了讲要保留你房间的海报，肖申克的救赎的主题是自由。

Many times we see the camera framed by doors and windows, suggesting **imprisonment**. Conversely, **aerial** shots are used to indicate **liberation**. In this shot, Andy experiences his last gasp of life on the outside as the limo brings him to Shawshank. Later, he plays Wolfgang Puck’s “The Marriage of Figaro” for the other inmates, using art to set them free. At the end, we see Andy and Red fully torqued on freedom.  
好多次相机拍摄的是门或窗，暗示坐牢。反之，从天空拍摄的影像表示解放。在安迪被豪华轿车带到监狱的时候，他经历了在外面最后一次自由的喘息，从天空取景。之后，他为狱友播放沃尔夫冈·帕克的费加罗的婚姻，使用艺术释放他们。最后，我们看到安迪和红在自由中旋转。

But the movie goes even deeper. Sure, it’s about a prison and all the wacky adventures that happen there, but lurking beneath is a hefty load existential undertones. Typical Hollywood. In his essay “**Existentialism is a Humanism**,” Jean Paul Sartre suggests that in the absence of God, **humans must define their own essence through the choices they make**, and also through the shampoo they use.  
但是电影讲得要更加深入。当然它是关于监狱和一切发生在里面得奇怪事儿，但藏在这之下的还有不少隐喻。典型的好莱坞风格。在让·保罗·萨特的文章“存在主义是一种人道主义”中提出上帝不在的时候，人类必须用他们做的选择来定义自己的存在，还有他们用的香波。

In this film, instead of God, we have the Warden, who is a “**perverse deity**” — Satan **masquerading** as a holy figure. He is always quoting the Christian bible and **bragging** about how many passages he has memorized, yet he is arbitrarily cruel and spiteful. He has a stitchwork quote about judgement on his wall, but behind it is the **vault** where he keeps records of his illegal activities, and probably some nudie mags.  
在电影中就不是上帝了，我们有典狱长和他那“邪恶的灵魂”，撒旦伪装成了圣洁的人物。他经常引用基督教圣经，炫耀自己记住了多少段落，但他表现出的却是放纵自己的残酷和恶意。他有一个编织的“神的审判”挂在墙上，后面藏的是他保存非法行为记录的保险柜，可能还有一些裸体杂志。

According to Sartre’s analogy: An **artisan** uses a tool to craft an object. He determines its essence, and the object has no say in the matter. Sucks for you, object! Similarly, if humans were crafted by God, that would mean humans have no say in their essence either. Sartre contends that “each man makes his essence as he lives,” and God plays no part in it.  
根据萨特的比喻：一名工匠使用工具来制作物件，那么就由工匠来决定物件的本质，物件说了不算。同样地，如果人是被上帝创造的，那就说明人就不能决定自己的本质。萨特反驳“每个人在生命的过程中决定自己的本质”，上帝在这件事上说了不算。

And he was right, just a little **premature**: as we all know, the being known as God abandoned Earth in the year 1991. 
他是对的，就是有点早了：我们都知道的是，被称为上帝在1991年放弃了地球。

Because of the Warden, inmates are not in charge of their own essence, or even their own **bowels**. The institution breaks them and the walls come to define who they are. Brooks loses his ability to live in the free world and turns to the seedy underworld of **graffiti** \[shot of him carving his name\] before ultimately calling it quits. Prison robs people of their will to freedom, and by extension, their humanity.  
由于典狱长的存在，囚犯们不对自己的本质负责，甚至是他们的肠子和膀胱。制度和围墙来定义他们是谁。布鲁克失去了生活在自由世界的能力，在最终称失去能力为退出之前变成了粗糙雕刻的褴褛老人。监狱剥夺了人们的自由意志，还有人性。

Sartre contrasts human beings with objects such as rocks, noting that rocks are their characteristics, whereas human beings create their characteristics, even if those characteristics are forged by wasting away in front of their television sets. Most of the prisoners become rocks — they allow their lack of physical freedom to dictate their sense of absolute freedom. In contrast, Andy doesn’t become a rock, he sculpts and breaks rocks with his trusty hammer, Thor Jr. The salvation lying within the Bible is not God, but rather Andy’s choice to embrace hope and liberate himself by any means necessary: in this case, a conveniently human-sized pipe. Andy tells Red he’ll laugh when he sees the rock hammer — in a place like Shawshank, hope is truly laughable. Plus, small things are funny.  
萨特通过物件例如岩石来和人类做比较，岩石始终都是岩石，而人类创造和改变自己，即使那些假的特征被浪费在了电视机前。大多数囚犯变成了岩石，他们任由自己身体的自由被绝对自由的感觉所主宰。作为对比，安迪没有变成岩石，他用他那可靠的锤子来雕刻岩石和凿穿岩壁。躺在圣经中的救世主不是上帝，而是石锤和安迪通过任何必要的手段去拥抱希望和解放自己的选择，具体地说是充满恶臭的管道。安迪告诉红，他看到石锤就会笑，在肖申克这样的地方，希望真是可笑。对了，小的事物都有趣。
