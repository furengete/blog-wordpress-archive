Director: Mr.Bob-san, you’re now comfortably sitting in your den. And there is a bottle of Suntory whisky on the table, you know? Please speak with full emotion, slowly, looking at the camera, tenderly, and just like meeting your old friend. Like Bogie in Casablanca. 'Toast to your eyes, Suntory time!'  
Translator: Um, he want you to turn, look in camera. Okay?  
Bob: That’s all he said?  
Translator: Yes. Turn to camera.  
Bob: All right, does he want me to… to turn from the right, or… turn from the left?  
Translator: (to the director) Well, he is ready to act. But he’s  
still wondering whether he should turn from the left or turn from the right when it starts…  
Director: Who cares about such things! We don’t have much time Bob-san, you know? Then quickly give me more high-tension. Look at the camera. Keep staring at it. Slowly, okay? Show more passion in your eyes. Alright?  
Translator: Right side, and, uh, with intensity. Okay?  
Bob: Is that everything? I mean, it seemed like he said quite a bit more than that.  
Director: What you say (in this commercial) does not mean only about the whiskey, you know? Like meeting an old friend, tenderly and gently. And an emotion flowing out from your heart! Don’t forget it!  
Translator: Like an old friend, and into the camera.  
Bob: …Okay.  
Director: Get it? You love whiskey. 'It’s Suntory time!' Okay?  
Bob: …Okay.  
Director: Okay? Ready? Action!  
Bob: (to camera) 'For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.'  
Director: Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Do you really understand? Or you joking? This is Suntory 'Hibiki' which is the most expensive whiskey in Suntory. Give me more high-grade feeling, okay? It’s not an ordinary booze!  
Translator: Uh, could you do it slower…  
Director: (to the translator) Luxury feeling. Translate it!  
Translator: and with more …intensity?  
Director: (with pointing his finger to Bob) 'Suntory time.' (to the crew) Okay? Ready? Action!  
Bob: (to camera, a bit more slowly than the last time) “For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.”  
Director: Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Give me a break!  
Bob: (says nothing and scowls at the director)
