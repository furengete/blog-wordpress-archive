https://en.wikiquote.org/ is a free online compendium of sourced quotations from notable people and creative works in every language, translations of non-English quotes.

For example, a movie I watched a couple of days ago, "_The Talented Mr. Ripley_".

**Tom Ripley**

- If I could just go back... if I could rub everything out... starting with myself.
- I always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
- You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had. I would do anything for you, Dickie.
- I really feel happy. As if I had been handed a whole new life.
- I could live Dickie's life _for_ him.
- Well, whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful, it all makes sense, doesn't it, in your head. You never meet anybody that thinks they're a bad person.
- _\[while planning to kill Marge\]_ And that's the irony, Marge. I loved you. You may as well know it, Marge: I loved you. I don't know... maybe it's grotesque of me to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something and put it in your purse for a rainy day. 'Tom loves me.' 'Tom loves me.'

**Dickie Greenleaf**

- You know, without the glasses you're not even ugly.
- I could fuck this ice box, I love it so much.
- Now you'll find out why Ms. Sherwood shows up for breakfast, Tom. It's not love, it's my coffee machine.
- "See Venice and die," is what they say? Or is it Rome?
    - Confusing cities in the famous expression, "See Naples and die!"
- I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first class education.
- Marge — Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that too. Such low class, Marge. Does this guy know anything?
- I love the fact that you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?

**Dialogue**

**Dickie Greenleaf**: Everybody should have one talent, what's yours?
**Tom Ripley**: Telling lies, forging signatures and impersonating almost anybody.
**Dickie Greenleaf**: That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. So, do an impression.
**Tom Ripley**: What, now?
**Dickie Greenleaf**: Yeah.
**Tom Ripley**: _\[imitating Dickie's father\]_ "The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance."
**Dickie Greenleaf**: _\[stunned\]_ What?
**Tom Ripley**: "Oh, I love to sail, believe me, I love to sail. Instead, I _make_ sailboats, and other people sail them."
**Dickie Greenleaf**: Stop! It's too much. You're making the hairs on my neck stand up!
**Tom Ripley**: "Oh, yes, jazz? Let's face it, jazz is insolent noise."
**Dickie Greenleaf**: It's like he's here. Horrible, like the old bastard's here! That's brilliant! Brilliant! How do you know him?
**Tom Ripley**: Oh, I met him in New York.
**Dickie Greenleaf**: Marge, you have to hear this! This is scary. Marge Sherwood, I'd like you to meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf, the First.
**Tom Ripley**: "How do you do, Marge. Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so."
**Marge Sherwood**: I... I don't get it.
**Dickie Greenleaf**: It's uncanny!
**Tom Ripley**: _\[turning to Dickie\]_ "Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom? Bring him back?"
**Dickie Greenleaf**: _\[confused\]_ What?
**Tom Ripley**: "I'd pay you if you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you a thousand dollars."
